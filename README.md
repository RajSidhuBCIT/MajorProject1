My Practicum for the BTECH course. Titled The Dungeon of Kings, this game is a 2d Roguelike that features a high degree of difficulty and permenant death. Built in Unity and C#, The Dungeon of Kings consists of fifteen levels including 3 bosses. Not for sale. This game was created using Open Source resources and is free to download and play.
